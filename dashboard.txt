< proposal >
Project proposal revision needs to be completed before turning in

< pagination > 
I want there to be a limit of 10 products per page and for the user 
to be able to switch pages

< quantity >
All products need a quantity that represents how many are in that 
specific users cart at any given time. There should be 
increment-decrement functionality as well

< update total in DOM >
HTML total prices update when adding to and removing from cart 

< sort >
Sort by price, ratings, or unsorted

< clean up app.js and app.py >
They both could use some major refactoring later on

< routes to url_for() >
Change all hard-coded routes in HTML files to url_for() 

< turn in >
Setup Heroku and deploy

< wide images >
Some product images are too wide for the card container. NOTE that
this can be fixed by either going back to tall cards OR by making the
cards themselves wider

< adding to cart not working >
When a logged in user adds to their cart, they cannot increment or 
decrement the item unless there is a page refresh. That needs to be 
fixed ASAP as I cannot turn this in unitl that is a done deal!

< qty element >
The qty element is touching the element to its right -> "3in cart" 
should be "3 in cart"
