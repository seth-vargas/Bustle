TODO < proposal >
Project proposal revision needs to be completed before turning in

TODO : < pagination > 
I want there to be a limit of 10 products per page and for the user 
to be able to switch pages

TODO : < quantity >
All products need a quantity that represents how many are in that 
specific users cart at any given time. There should be 
increment-decrement functionality as well

TODO : < update total in DOM >
HTML total prices update when adding to and removing from cart 

TODO : < sort >
Sort by price, ratings, or unsorted

TODO: < turn in >

BUG  < wide images >
Some product images are too wide for the card container. NOTE that
this can be fixed by either going back to tall cards OR by making the
cards themselves wider
