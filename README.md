1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?  
My website will provide users the weather in their area, along with the ability to search for the weather in any city

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?  
All kinds of users will visit my site, I have no demographic (aside from anyone who uses a computer)

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.  
A user, which consists of a username, password, and preferred location that defaults to their current location

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:  

* What does your database schema look like?  
Short and sweet, as there is no complicated relationships 


* What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?  
The uptime for free plans is only 95%, which is not great.


* Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?  
The users password and current location should be secured


* What functionality will your app include?  
A search function, in-app navigation and RESTful routing


* What will the user flow look like?  
A user can sign up or log in, and then will be taken to their hub. From there, they can search up a city and find specific weather related things there!


* What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?  
I don't have any features that make it more than CRUD. I will consult my mentor about that.
