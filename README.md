# Bustle: Capstone 1

## Project overview

Bustle is an e-commerce website where you can browse a *very* limited selection of items!
This project took hours of labor, but in the end I think the final product is not too shabby.
There are bound to be bugs that I either did not see or are currently putting off until after
I finish my course, but until then if you find something feel free to reach out to me and I
will check it out.

## Getting started
* Fork the repository
* run seed.py (you may need to install PostgreSQL's CLI tool and create your own db)
* navigate to localhost:3000 and sign up for an account, or use one of the premade
  accounts found in seed.py!

## What 3rd party software did I use?
I used the Stripe API to handle creation of products, retrival of products, and creating checkout 
sessions, Bootstrap for styling, and Jquery in some parts of my code. Honestly, my use of Jquery
is inconsistent, but I was okay with what I used it for and what I did not use it for. I also used
the [fakestoreAPI](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api) made by [keikaavousi](https://github.com/keikaavousi) as dummy data for my project.

## Future plans? More coming soon?
As of now this project is not a priority of mine, but it is a project I want to improve upon as my
skills in software development continue to grow. There is a lot I wanted to do with this that ended
up getting cut out, but there is always time for those things later!
